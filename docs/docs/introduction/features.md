# Boson Framework Features

Boson provides a comprehensive set of features designed to make web development in C++ both powerful and enjoyable. This page details the key capabilities that make Boson an excellent choice for high-performance web applications.

## Core Features

### HTTP Server

- **High-performance HTTP/1.1 support**: Handle thousands of concurrent connections efficiently
- **Asynchronous request handling**: Process requests in parallel without blocking
- **TLS/SSL support**: Secure communication with proper certificate management
- **Graceful shutdown**: Clean termination of connections during server shutdown
- **Connection pooling**: Efficient reuse of connections for optimal performance
- **Keep-alive management**: Handle persistent connections properly
- **Custom socket options**: Fine-tune network parameters for specific use cases

### Routing System

- **Expressive route definitions**: Define routes with clear, readable syntax
- **Path parameters**: Extract variables from URL paths (e.g., `/users/:id`)
- **Regular expression constraints**: Apply validation rules to path parameters
- **Route groups**: Organize related routes with shared prefixes
- **HTTP method constraints**: Specific handlers for GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.
- **Named routes**: Reference routes by name for URL generation
- **Router mounting**: Compose routers hierarchically for modular applications
- **Automatic OPTIONS handling**: Proper handling of CORS preflight requests

### Middleware Framework

- **Global middleware**: Apply processing to all requests
- **Route-specific middleware**: Apply processing to specific routes only
- **Middleware chaining**: Build complex processing pipelines
- **Next function**: Control flow between middleware components
- **Early termination**: Stop processing and send immediate responses when needed
- **Error middleware**: Special handling for error conditions
- **Built-in middleware**: Common functionality like logging, request parsing, etc.
- **Custom middleware creation**: Easily extend the framework with application-specific processing

### Request and Response Abstraction

- **Clean object-oriented models**: Type-safe access to HTTP elements
- **Headers management**: Easy access and manipulation of HTTP headers
- **Query parameters**: Parse and access URL query strings
- **Route parameters**: Access variables extracted from the URL path
- **Request body parsing**: Handle different content types (JSON, form data, etc.)
- **File uploads**: Process multipart form data with file attachments
- **Content negotiation**: Respond with the appropriate format based on Accept headers
- **Cookies**: Read and set HTTP cookies with security options
- **Streaming responses**: Efficiently handle large response bodies
- **Status code helpers**: Set appropriate HTTP status codes with semantic methods
- **Redirect helpers**: Easily create HTTP redirects

### Static File Serving

- **Efficient file serving**: Stream files directly to clients
- **Directory serving**: Make entire directories available
- **MIME type detection**: Proper Content-Type headers based on file extensions
- **Conditional requests**: Support for If-Modified-Since and ETag headers
- **Cache control**: Configure browser caching behavior
- **Custom options**: Fine-tune static file serving for specific needs
- **Security**: Prevent directory traversal and other common vulnerabilities

### JSON Support

- **Integrated JSON library**: Built-in support for JSON parsing and serialization
- **Type conversion**: Automatic conversion between C++ types and JSON
- **JSON response helpers**: Easily send JSON responses
- **JSON request parsing**: Automatically parse JSON request bodies
- **JSON validation**: Validate incoming JSON against schemas or structures
- **Pretty printing**: Readable JSON output for debugging

### Error Handling

- **Global error handlers**: Process uncaught exceptions
- **Route-specific error handlers**: Custom error handling for specific routes
- **Structured error responses**: Consistent error format for APIs
- **Development-friendly errors**: Detailed error information during development
- **Production error handling**: Safe error responses in production
- **Custom exception types**: Handle application-specific error conditions
- **HTTP status mapping**: Map exceptions to appropriate HTTP status codes

### Controllers

- **Class-based organization**: Group related routes logically
- **Method binding**: Use class methods as route handlers
- **Resource controllers**: Easily implement RESTful resources
- **Shared state**: Maintain state across related route handlers
- **Dependency injection**: Access services and dependencies in controllers
- **Controller middleware**: Apply middleware to all routes in a controller

## Advanced Features


### CLI Tooling

- **Project scaffolding**: Generate new projects with proper structure
- **Component generation**: Create controllers, middleware, and other components
- **Build management**: Simplify the build process
- **Development server**: Hot-reload capability for faster development
- **Project templates**: Different starting points for various application types

## Developer Experience

### Error Handling

- **Comprehensive exception handling**: Catch and process errors appropriately
- **Development-friendly error pages**: Detailed error information during development
- **Production error logging**: Safe error handling with proper logging
- **Custom error handlers**: Process errors in application-specific ways
- **Input validation**: Validate and sanitize user input

### Logging and Debugging

- **Structured logging**: Organized log output with levels and categories
- **Multiple outputs**: Log to console, file, or other destinations
- **Request logging**: Track incoming requests and their processing
- **Performance metrics**: Monitor application performance
- **Debug helpers**: Tools to inspect application state

### Performance Optimization

- **Runtime monitoring**: Track resource usage and performance metrics
- **Memory usage optimization**: Efficient memory management
- **Request/response caching**: Store and reuse responses for identical requests
- **Lazy loading**: Load resources only when needed
- **Connection management**: Efficient handling of client connections

By leveraging these features, developers can build robust, high-performance web applications in C++ with less effort and greater reliability.
