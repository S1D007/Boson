## 🚀 Stunning Performance

```cpp
// A simple "Hello World" benchmark achieved these results on modest hardware
Requests per second: 102,443
Mean latency: 0.97ms
99th percentile: 1.64ms
Memory usage: 3.2MB
```

**Performance Comparison**

## ✨ Elegant, Express-Inspired API

```cpp
#include <boson/boson.hpp>

int main() {
    boson::initialize();
    boson::Server app;

    app.use([](const boson::Request& req, boson::Response& res, boson::NextFunction& next) {
        std::cout << "[" << req.method() << "] " << req.path() << std::endl;
        next();
    });

    app.get("/", [](const boson::Request& req, boson::Response& res) {
        res.send("Hello, Boson!");
    });

    app.get("/api/data", [](const boson::Request& req, boson::Response& res) {
        res.jsonObject({
            {"message", "Welcome to Boson"},
            {"version", "1.0"},
            {"success", true},
            {"data", {
                {"users", 42},
                {"active", true}
            }}
        });
    });

    app.get("/api/users/:id", [](const boson::Request& req, boson::Response& res) {
        std::string id = req.param("id");
        res.jsonObject({
            {"id", id},
            {"name", "User " + id},
            {"email", "user" + id + "@example.com"}
        });
    });

    app.configure(3000, "127.0.0.1");
    return app.listen();
}
```
